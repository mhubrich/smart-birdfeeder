# Rule: Documentation & READMEs

## Core Principle
The project must be navigable by a stranger. Documentation is not an afterthought; it is a deliverable.

## Required Files

### 1. Root README (`/README.md`)
Include sections for: Project Overview, Tech Stack, Features, Installation Guide, Configuration, Core Modules, Usage Examples, API Endpoints, How to Start Application, How To Run Tests, and Contribution Guidelines. Use markdown with proper headers, code blocks for commands, and emojis for section titles.

### 2. Module READMEs
Every major subdirectory (`/vision`, `/server`, `/client`) must have its own `README.md`.
